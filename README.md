The challenge consists of two parts, make sure to complete both before submitting. Good luck!

ðŸ¦• Challenge 1: You're applying for a summer internship at the National Museum of Natural History. 
The museum recently created a database containing all dinosaur records of past field campaigns. 
Your job is to dive into the fossil records to find interesting insights and advise the museum on the data quality.

1. How many different dinosaur names are present in the data?
2. Which was the largest dinosaur? What about missing data in the dataset?
3. What dinosaur type has the most occurrences in this dataset? Create a visualization (table, bar chart, or equivalent) to display the number of dinosaurs per type. Use the AI assistant to tweak your visualization (colors, labels, title...).
4. Did dinosaurs get bigger over time? Show the relation between the dinosaur length and their age to illustrate this.
5. Use the AI assitant to create an interactive map showing each record. 
6. Any other insights you found during your analysis?
